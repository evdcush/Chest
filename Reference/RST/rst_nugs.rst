*************************
SUPER DUPER "DISCOVERIES"
*************************

Sections
========
The weight or sizing of section titles has **absolutely nothing to do with the type of char used**.
Sections/titles that have the same style char lines *have the same weight*. 

Any other type of line you put *below* the title char line will be smaller. But any section with a line style matching some section above it **will have the same size/weight as that line**.



==============================================
GOOD COLOR SCHEMES FOR RST IMPROVED IN SUBLIME
==============================================

--------
TOP-TIER
--------
These colors generally all support syntax highlighting on each type of rst list, meaning the definition word in def lists is bolded or different color, option lists, biblio fields, etc. all have highlighting. 

**Dark**
- Wildlife_Night: clearest, easiest to read dark. Really like the coloring of literal blocks
- Poyeyo_Blue
- Github_Dark
- Kane
- Neon-kush


**Medium** *(generally more dark than light, but think "brown" or "grey" or "seagreen")*
- Forest Focus
- Oblivion
- Wombat

**Light**
- Github_Light
- Eiffel
- Foggy_morning

----------
ALSO GREAT
----------
These color schemes also have excellent syntax highlighting support for RST, but are not "top-tier" generally because they don't highlight certain things, or other idiosyncrasies.
