# OpenMMLab

Notes on using packages in the MMLab ecosystem.

# Installation

Recently installed `mmengine`.

They tell you to install via this tool they also develop called `mim`.

The pypi package is `openmim`

[GitHub - open-mmlab/mim: MIM Installs OpenMMLab Packages](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mim)



So the sequence would be:

```shell
pip install -U openmim
mim install mmengine
```

**hell nah brother** üê∏

Not using any bullshit like that.

No elaboration either on what likely pathing hacks and env vars `mim` is doing without telling you.

So I've tentatively decided to just install the packages directly through `pip` and just see what happens.
