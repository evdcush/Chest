### Text Editors
There seem to be a respectable number of editors out there.
It's no longer a Sublime vs. X, Y kinda thing--hasn't been for some time now.



#### GUI

I use vsc for my main dev--mostly for its remote/ssh capabilities.

I use Sublime text for everything else.



I've since felt like neither really suits my needs fully.



Sublime... is dead.

vsc is just busy, slow, can't have multiple windows, etc...
Maybe vsc *could* suit your needs, IF you actually spent some time to learn
hotkeys and features!



#### CLI



##### VIM

I don't know anything about vim.

I don't have a dotfile for vim.

I don't know why I would ever use it except for basic, simple editing (which
is all I currently use it for).

But what if vim provided tools and was configurable enough that you could
achieve even 20% of your workflow in it (over gui editors)?

**I need to learn more here.**
