This whole process was pretty tricky; there were many steps involved and you
depended heavily on shell history commands to get the proper command.

Basically, everything you did was referenced from the Real Python tutorial:
https://realpython.com/pypi-publish-python-package/

@TODO(evan): proper steps here (AT LEAST shell hist commands).

##  GOTCHAS  ##
* I remember most of the gotchas being with **versioning** and **build/**.
  - If you messed up something with a build, and pushed that to pypi,
    you cannot simply rebuild and push again as you CANNOT PUSH UPDATES/CHANGES
    TO SAME VERSION. It's tedious, but you must make a new version for ANY
    change.

# Updating a package
# ==================
* When you update a package, you need to change VERSION and such in several
  places.
  - There may be tools to help you automate this process, rather than doing it
    manually.

# TIPS
# ----
Reference other packages' release commits to see precisely what they change
in order to update a package.

# eg, openai/gym: https://github.com/openai/gym/releases
https://github.com/openai/gym/commit/2c50315aabab8e5d25a59bb12b430a18e152f01f
