# Updating a package
# ==================
* When you update a package, you need to change VERSION and such in several
  places.
  - There may be tools to help you automate this process, rather than doing it
    manually.

# TIPS
# ----
Reference other packages' release commits to see precisely what they change
in order to update a package.

# eg, openai/gym: https://github.com/openai/gym/releases
