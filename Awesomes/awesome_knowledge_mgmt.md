# Notes

### Taking Good Notes

- Andy Matuschak on Note-writing systems: https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zEZi3ytBhZHHweRYNAosQ1g
- Karpathy's note method
- Michael Nielsen
- (Probably lesswrong, etc.)

## Note Apps

Holy shit there are so many "note apps" out there.

Here are a few, with a focus on FLOSS instead of crap like evernote.

- [ü•á **laurent22/joplin**: Joplin - the secure note taking and to-do app with synchronisation capabilities for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS.](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin)

   - The CHAMP üíØ

- [üåü **AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy**: AppFlowy is an open-source alternative to Notion. You are in charge of your data and customizations. Built with Flutter and Rust.](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy)

   - The **most promising app I've used**: boards, calendar, document, grid

      - I cannot escape the feel of being my content being locked-in to the app

      - Also, due to the bugginess, I have already once lost almost all my notes

      - **low trust of app, but really hope it continues to get developed and adopted!**

   - Multi-platform: Linux (deb, flatpak), Android

   - Still fairly "beta"

   - Buggy on Linux (enormous lag when opening grids or boards)

- [**Zettlr/Zettlr**: A Markdown Editor for the 21st century.](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr)

   - ALPHA; deeply opinionated layout/view; more of a "shiny thing" fad than a legit tool

- [**logseq/logseq**: A privacy-first, open-source platform for knowledge management and collaboration.](https://github.com/logseq/logseq)

   - Too bigbrain; need to learn to use; you spend more time in tinkering and config and "workflow" than actual notes

   - seems like its for the Arch-like tribe, who like to configure and spend their time on process instead of content or doing stuff

- [**Obsidian** is a personal knowledge base and note-taking software application that operates on Markdown files.](https://obsidian.md/)

   - **(Proprietary)**

   - Arguably the most popular; huge community; massive ecosystem of plugins

      - Re: plugins, and the community turbo nerds and zealots, wow... the dream for a closed-source platform: you get all the FLOSS support and dev for fucking free!

   - Business model basically forces you to pay, since there is otherwise no note sync

      - (just sync your "vault" through nextcloud, etc.)

- [**siyuan-note/siyuan**: A privacy-first, self-hosted, fully open source personal knowledge management software](https://github.com/siyuan-note/siyuan)

   - kind of a dark horse to me; it's an old name in the game; nothing like Jop, but more established than obsidian or "logseq" or appflowy, etc.
      - I've always passed on it since they have "freemium" model on basic features, and that it seems to be primarily chinese-market focused
   - Really want to try this one out; has great looking features!
   - **Multi-platform:** Linux (AppImage, flatpak, bin), Android, Windows
   - Has a web-clipper ([chromium](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/siyuan/hkcgjbeblifaincobbcfiffbpgoafepk))

- [**toeverything/AFFiNE**: There can be more than Notion and Miro. AFFiNE is a next-gen knowledge base that brings planning, sorting and creating all together. Privacy first, open-source, customizable and ready to use.](https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE)

   - Is super interesting looking, but *painfully* pre-alpha

      - was hella buggy and broken for me when I tried it
         - initially (early 2024)
         - again (mid 2025)
         - I truly hope AFFiNE continues to mature! I think they are providing an essential service or product that isn't otherwise found in FLOSS

- [**Traverse.link**: "*Traverse is the only app with mind mapping, note-taking and spaced repetition flashcards in one place.*"](https://traverse.link)

   - (Proprietary)üòêÔ∏è

   - Neat integrations of linked/mapped knowledge and learning

- [**suchnsuch/Tangent**: *Tangent is designed to let you write the way you think. Your thoughts are connected; Tangent lets you link to existing notes and make new ones with ease.*.](https://github.com/suchnsuch/Tangent)

   - https://www.tangentnotes.com/

   - Amazing work by the developer!!

   - I've used played around with it a bit, but due to my severe "shiny note-taking thing" syndrome, I haven't gone deeper, but I'm amazed at how polished the (single dev) app is

- [LinwoodDev/Butterfly: Powerful, minimalistic, cross-platform, opensource note-taking app](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly)

   - ?? handwriting, that's why I added this. Otherwise don't care.

- [**(DISCONTINUED)** **zadam/trilium**: Build your personal knowledge base with Trilium Notes](https://github.com/zadam/trilium)

- Extensions:

   - VSCode (some of these might be defunct now):

      - [dendronhq/dendron: The personal knowledge management (PKM) tool that grows as you do!](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron)

      - [foambubble/foam: A personal knowledge management and sharing system for VSCode](https://github.com/foambubble/foam)

- [Tana](https://tana.inc/): "AI-Native workspace..." ü§Æ

- [Kinopio](https://kinopio.club/): actually kind of great! Looks cheap but is a fairly featured mapping thing!

## Editors

### Markup

Almost all editors for markup are for markdown.

And my goodness, there are a lot of markdown editors. I won't list them all here; just the ones I've used and liked.

- [üèÖ **marktext/marktext**: üìùA simple and elegant markdown editor, available for Linux, macOS and Windows.](https://github.com/marktext/marktext)

   - The best, but not without various bugs
   - Has been unmaintained since 2022; no signs of change
      - Has a best-effort attempt fork here: [GitHub - jacobwhall/marktext: fork of marktext, seeking to modernize our favorite markdown editor](https://github.com/jacobwhall/marktext)

- [GitHub - KDE/ghostwriter: Text editor for Markdown](https://github.com/KDE/ghostwriter)

   - This use to be my main text editor for markdown way back in the day (2017)

      - It was awesome then, still awesome, still extremely minimal (in a good way)

   - This is more of a "zen"/"focus" mode kind of editor

# Mapping

Most actually useable mapping software is proprietary and paid.
This space is brutal and desperately needs more development.

FLOSS options I've tried are generally either too simple, or too complex and look and feel like shit, and require a lot of "how to use" learning.

- [XMind](https://xmind.app/)

   - XMind 8

- Freeplane

   - No, I don't feel like learning how to use this
   - Looks like shit (not in a good way)
   - UI looks like shit and is overcrowded

- Heimer

- (A bunch of other simple, FLOSS ones)

- [coggle](https://coggle.it)

   - Pretty decent, fairly limited, customizability (in a good way)

   - I love that you can actually have a node with full markdown support

   - Has a "free" plan, which sucks and you need to pay if you actually want to do anything with this

- [TheBrain](https://thebrain.com/)

- Heptabase looks dope (proprietary; paid)
