# Notes

Holy shit there are so many "note apps" out there.

Here are a few, with a focus on FLOSS instead of crap like evernote.

- [ü•á **laurent22/joplin**: Joplin - the secure note taking and to-do app with synchronisation capabilities for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS.](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin)
  
   - The CHAMP üíØ

- [üåü **AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy**: AppFlowy is an open-source alternative to Notion. You are in charge of your data and customizations. Built with Flutter and Rust.](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy)
  
   - The **most promising app I've used**: boards, calendar, document, grid
     
      - I cannot escape the feel of being my content being locked-in to the app
     
      - Also, due to the bugginess, I have already once lost almost all my notes
     
      - **low trust of app, but really hope it continues to get developed and adopted!**
  
   - Multi-platform: Linux (deb, flatpak), Android
  
   - Still fairly "beta"
  
   - Buggy on Linux (enormous lag when opening grids or boards)

- [**Zettlr/Zettlr**: A Markdown Editor for the 21st century.](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr)
  
   - ALPHA; deeply opinionated layout/view
     
      - Ridiculous note margin padding (this reason alone keeps me from pursuing this app further)
   - Has zotero integration allegedly; and supposed to support latex and other scholarly writing needs

- [**logseq/logseq**: A privacy-first, open-source platform for knowledge management and collaboration.](https://github.com/logseq/logseq)
  
   - Too bigbrain; need to learn to use
  
   - seems like its for the Arch-like tribe, who like to configure and spend their time on process instead of content or doing stuff

- [**Obsidian** is a personal knowledge base and note-taking software application that operates on Markdown files.](https://obsidian.md/)
  
   - (Proprietary)
  
   - Arguably the most popular; huge community; massive ecosystem of plugins
  
   - Business model basically forces you to pay, since there is otherwise no note sync

- [üîñ **siyuan-note/siyuan**: A privacy-first, self-hosted, fully open source personal knowledge management software](https://github.com/siyuan-note/siyuan)
  
   - Really want to try this one out; has great looking features!
   - **Multi-platform:** Linux (AppImage, flatpak, bin), Android, Windows
   -  Has a web-clipper ([chromium](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/siyuan/hkcgjbeblifaincobbcfiffbpgoafepk))

- [**toeverything/AFFiNE**: There can be more than Notion and Miro. AFFiNE is a next-gen knowledge base that brings planning, sorting and creating all together. Privacy first, open-source, customizable and ready to use.](https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE) 
  
   - Is super interesting looking, but pre-alpha
     
      - was hella buggy and broken for me when I tried it

- [üîñ **Traverse.link**: "*Traverse is the only app with mind mapping, note-taking and spaced repetition flashcards in one place.*"](https://traverse.link)
  
   - (Proprietary)
  
   - Neat integrations of linked/mapped knowledge and learning

- [üîñ **suchnsuch/Tangent**: *Tangent is designed to let you write the way you think. Your thoughts are connected; Tangent lets you link to existing notes and make new ones with ease.*.](https://github.com/suchnsuch/Tangent)
  
   - https://www.tangentnotes.com/
  
   - Looks amazing! (Haven't yet tried)

## Editors

### Markup

Almost all editors for markup are for markdown.

And my goodness, there are a lot of markdown editors. I won't list them all here; just the ones I've used and liked.

- [üèÖ **marktext/marktext**: üìùA simple and elegant markdown editor, available for Linux, macOS and Windows.](https://github.com/marktext/marktext)
  
   - The best, but not without various bugs
   - Has been unmaintained since 2022; no signs of change
      - Has a best-effort attempt fork here: [GitHub - jacobwhall/marktext: fork of marktext, seeking to modernize our favorite markdown editor](https://github.com/jacobwhall/marktext)
      - fdsa

- [GitHub - KDE/ghostwriter: Text editor for Markdown](https://github.com/KDE/ghostwriter)
  
   - This use to be my main text editor for markdown way back in the day (2017)
     
      - It was awesome then, still awesome, still extremely minimal (in a good way)
  
   - This is more of a "zen"/"focus" mode kind of editor

# Mapping

Most actually useable mapping software is proprietary and paid.

FLOSS options I've tried are generally either too simple, or too complex and look and feel like shit, and require a lot of "how to use" learning.

- [XMind](https://xmind.app/)
  
   - XMind 8

- Freeplane
  
   - No, I don't feel like learning how to use this

- Heimer

- (A bunch of other simple, FLOSS ones)

- [coggle](https://coggle.it)
  
   - Pretty decent, fairly limited, customizeability (in a good way)
  
   - I love that you can actually have a node with full markdown support
  
   - Has a "free" plan, which sucks and you need to pay if you actually want to do anything with this
