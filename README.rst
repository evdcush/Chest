Chest
=====
A place I keep stuff.

:Cheat_:
    Files in cheat are partly cheatsheet, partly snippets.

    Symlinked to the cheat dir from https://github.com/cheat/cheat

:Dots_:
    dotfiles, mostly shell config stuff

:Reference_:
    Miscellaneous notes, snippets, scratch space

:Resources_:
    Assets and templates.

:Scripts_:
    Cloned and orphaned scripts. Some scripts are for reference. Good ones usually evolve into a separate repo or another VC'd scripts repo.

:Setup_:
    Contains my notes on my post-install process and a log of python packages.
