# Pytorch Frameworks

Frameworks built on top of pytorch.



- Ignite

- MMLab

- Lightning

- HF's stack (accelerate, transformers, etc...)

- TNT

- Detectron2

**MAKE REPORT OF STRAIGHT DOPE SEND-IT WITH EACH FRAMEWORK!**

- Do DETR

   - Implement in each framework

- Workflow analysis:

   - Dataloading

   - Logging

   - Training

   - Distributed

   - Hooks

   - Inference

   - Visualization

   - Validation

   - Speed

   - Export

   - Nifty tricks

      - Integrations

- Good parts

- Bad parts

# Observations ðŸ”Ž

I read through a lot of "hot-off-the-press" repos that are published along with the paper.

Focusing on vision models, what I see:

- General framework:
   - pytorch
   - jax
- timm
- lightning
- mmdetection
- Detectron2
- Pure torch

This document is to serve as a best-effort log of observations.

# PyTorch

The categories are roughly ordered by what I see most commonly.

## timm

## Pure Torch

## MMLab

## Lightning
