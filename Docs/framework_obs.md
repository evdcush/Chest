# Observations ðŸ”Ž

I read through a lot of "hot-off-the-press" repos that are published along with the paper.

Focusing on vision models, what I see:

- General framework:
   - pytorch
   - jax
- timm
- lightning
- mmdetection
- Detectron2
- Pure torch

This document is to serve as a best-effort log of observations.

# PyTorch

The categories are roughly ordered by what I see most commonly.

## timm



## Pure Torch



## MMLab



## Lightning
