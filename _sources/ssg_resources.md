- Cross Platform It runs on Linux, OSX and Windows.
100% File Based All source data is well structured and can be tracked in a version control system or cloud storage like Dropbox.

- Flat-File Database All source data is stored in a flat-file tree database and can be freely queried. The layout of that data is completely configurable.
