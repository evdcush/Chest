# DEBUGGING a500 (DEC 2025): why the f is cuda locked to 12.6?


#==== UPDATE (JAN 2026):
#     it appears this whole claptrap CUDA-related pathing nonsense is maybe
#     no longer necessary?
#     I've been doin the same shit with CUDA, cuDNN, and libs for so long now
#     i don't yactually recall why we needed this in first place.
#     you likely have a note either in:
#     - `Chest/Setup/*`: (setup notes prob)
#     - `Chest/Reference/*`: (troubleshit.rst, howdoi.rst,
#                          cuda_happy_fun_time.rst, etc.)
#     - `Projects/tensorflow-wheels/`: guide
#
#    SPAGHETT --> WALL GUESS:
#        this was for cuDNN primarily (esp. `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`), and maybe bc
#        we used to have to do more arcane shit to setup cuda on rig
#
#    TODO(evo, JAN 5 2026): del this bish
#
#        **IF YOU OPEN THIS MF AGAIN IN FUT, AND YOU'VE OTHERWISE EXPERIENCED
#          NO NVIDIA-RELATED くだらん POPPYCOCK SHIT ---> DEL THIS DOT**
